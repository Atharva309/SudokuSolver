# Sudoku Solver Using Genetic Algorithm

The Sudoku puzzle solver project is an implementation of the popular Sudoku puzzle game using a genetic algorithm. The goal of the game is to fill a 9x9 grid with numbers so that each column, row, and 3x3 subgrid contains all the numbers from 1 to 9.

A genetic algorithm is a search heuristic inspired by the process of natural selection. In this project, the genetic algorithm is used to find the best solution to the Sudoku puzzle. The algorithm works by creating a population of potential solutions, then selecting the fittest individuals and breeding them to create new offspring. This process is repeated over multiple generations until a satisfactory solution is found.

The original author of the project is Christian Thomas Jacobs, who developed this as part of the CS3M6 Evolutionary Computation module at the University of Reading. The code is licensed under the MIT License, which allows for open-source distribution and modification of the code.
